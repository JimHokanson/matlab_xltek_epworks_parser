It is not yet finished.

## Triggering ##

Stimuli on multiple electrodes can be delivered via a timeline. Groups attach themselves to a timeline, capturing data with respect to the timeline. Traces attach themselves to a group.

## Filtering ##

The signals are filtered using hardware. It seems like all data files are saved to disk with only hardware filtering. Software filters can then be selected depending on preference. The presented data is currently not filtered.
